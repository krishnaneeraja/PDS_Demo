Issues related to the 94SDK(452).


1.cp: cannot stat `92POS_SELFDIAG/*': No such file or directory
actually the folder is there with name of 94POS_SELFIDAG.
2.cp: cannot stat `tootchain/sqlite/lib*': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat `tootchain/sqlite/*.h': No such file or directory
In 94sdkcd the directory is by the name of toolchain.
3.
`download' -> `/usr/sbin/download'
`download/uninstall.sh' -> `/usr/sbin/download/uninstall.sh'
`download/newmkapp' -> `/usr/sbin/download/newmkapp'
`download/INSTALL.sh' -> `/usr/sbin/download/INSTALL.sh'
`download/.xvpics' -> `/usr/sbin/download/.xvpics'
`download/.xvpics/mht2C_bmp.c' -> `/usr/sbin/download/.xvpics/mht2C_bmp.c'
`download/download' -> `/usr/sbin/download/download'
`download/mht2C_bmp.bmp' -> `/usr/sbin/download/mht2C_bmp.bmp'
It is coping the whole folder in the /usr/sbin that is not required.
Due to this we are not able to use newmkapp & download exe.
4.chmod +x dowmload/Install should be given in the Install.sh.
5.chmod +x toolchain/Install should be given in the Install.sh.
6.All the header files & library are there with the name of 91 rather than 92.


Selfdiag issues:

1.For printer Motor test the motor is moving but it is showing motor failed on the LCD.
2.Description(usage) of the Firm ware upgrade is not there in the documentation.

Documentation issues.

1.Required to change the documentation from 91 POS to 92 POS.
2.Renaming of the library from 91 to 92.
3.Documents related to the specific exe should be given seperatedly for understanding its usage.
